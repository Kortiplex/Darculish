# Darculish README

## Description

Darculish is a theme for Visual Studio Code that attempts to color the editor, syntax, and semantic code highlighting to that of Jet Brains' Darcula theme.

## Color Authenticity

### Accuracy
Most colors are taken directly from the Darcula theme using [Microsoft PowerToys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/)' [ColorPicker](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/color-picker) tool, so the accuracy should be fairly close, if not exact.


### Deviations
Due to the difference in the way VSCode handles syntax and semantic highlighting, some colors may not be possible to match exactly, and in very few cases, I have edited the colors of specific elements to make them more visible. 

The most egregious case of this is probably the semantic highlighting of 'class' type elements, which now display with a white (`#d9e4eb`) color. (I've always disliked how the Darcula theme made them so dark and so similar to other elements.)
