# Darculish README

## Description

Darculish is a theme for Visual Studio Code that attempts to color the editor, syntax, and semantic code highlighting to that of Jet Brains' Darcula theme.

_This is still a W.I.P. effort, so not all colors may be correct._

## Accuracy
Most colors are taken directly from the Darcula theme using Windows PowerToy's ColorPicker tool, so the accuracy should be fairly close, if not exact.

## Deviations
Due to the difference in the way VSCode handles syntax and semantic highlighting, some colors may not be possible to match exactly, and in very few cases, I have edited the colors of specific elements to make them more visible. 

The most egregious case of this, is probably the way I changed the semantic highlighting of 'class' type elements, which now display with a white (`#d9e4eb`) color. (I've always disliked how the Darcula theme made them so dark and so similar to other elements.)
